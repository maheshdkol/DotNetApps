@{
    Layout = "~/Views/Shared/_Layout.cshtml";
}

@*
The _ViewStart.cshtml page is a special view page containing the statement declaration to include the Layout page.

Instead of declaring the Layout page in every view page, we can use the _ViewStart page.

When a View Page Start is running, the “_ViewStart.cshtml” page will assign the Layout page for it.

So the application will be less maintainable.
